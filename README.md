Script to build fast, static schedule pages for the annual Minnesota Fringe Festival.

Scrapes data from the festival's dynamic website, which often loads waaaay too slow, and builds schedule pages for each of the 13 days.

*Not approved or endorsed by Minnesota Fringe, but I believe Fair Use, and a utility to Fringe "power users" like me.*

Just something I threw together.

## Technology
- node js
- **axios** for http requests
- **cheerio** for html parsing
- **mustache** templates
